<p>Rushes is a non-profit exhibition space in St Kilda, run by artists, art
workers and curators. We are dedicated to providing a platform to showcase contemporary video art from
both Australian and international artists. We look forward to working with
different artists, in all stages of their careers to explore, experiment and
take risks with their video practices, within the public realm.

The location of our screen offers an interesting opportunity to present art to
a wider audience and grow stronger connections between art and non-art
communities, in the hope of starting new, critical and conceptual dialogues
between unexpected viewers and casual passers.
